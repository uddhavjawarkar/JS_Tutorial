    <p><h3>Sir Dorabji Tata, and his cousin RD Tata, took Jamsetji Tata's dream of a fully Indian steel company to fruition.
         Tata Steel came into being in 1907 and holds the distinction of being Asia’s first integrated steel company.
        Tata Steel group is among the top global steel companies with an annual crude steel capacity of 33 million tonnes per annum (MnTPA). 
        It is one of the world's most geographically-diversified steel producers, with operations and commercial presence across the world. 
        A Great Place to Work-Certified™ organisation, Tata Steel, together with its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, is spread across five continents with an employee base of over 65,000.
        Among other accomplishments, Tata Steel bagged the Deming Application Prize and Deming Grand Prize for continuous improvement in 2008 and 2012 respectively, and has been recognised as the ‘Global Steel Industry Leader’ in ‘Steel category’ by Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) in 2018.
         The Company’s Jamshedpur Plant won the Prime Minister’s Trophy for the best performing integrated steel plant for 2016-17
