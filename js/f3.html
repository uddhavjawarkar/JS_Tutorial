    <p class="s1">Usually, people talk about a mother’s love and affection, in which a father’s love often gets ignored. 
        A mother’s love is talked about repeatedly everywhere, in movies, in shows and more. 
        Yet, what we fail to acknowledge is the strength of a father which often goes unnoticed. 
        Father’s a blessing which not many people have in their lives. 
        It would also be wrong to say that every father is the ideal hero for their kids because that is not the case. 
        However, I can vouch for my father without any second thoughts when it comes to being an ideal person.
        My Father is Different!
        As everyone likes to believe that their father is different, so do I. 
        Nonetheless, this conviction is not merely based on the love I have for him, but also because of his personality. 
        My father owns a business and is quite disciplined in all aspects of life. 
        He is the one who taught me to always practice discipline no matter what work I do.
        Most importantly, he has a jovial nature and always makes my mother laugh with his silly antics even after 27 years of marriage. 
        I completely adore this silly side of him when he is with his loved ones. 
        He tries his best to fulfill all our wishes but also maintains the strictness when the need arises.
